Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
Yes, nice readme and commits!

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?
Yes!

Were objects in JS used effectively?
-- The object constructor is never actually used in the jQuery user-facing code below - the variable is just passed unaltered

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?
Yes, very nice - nice fading/strikethrough effects

Is the site user-friendly?
Yes - weird behavior, as you are aware; you ran into the same frustration with this that we did!

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
-- No specs used in to do list construction?
